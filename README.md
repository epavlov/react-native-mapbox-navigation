Smart Mapbox turn-by-turn routing based on real-time traffic for React Native. A navigation UI ready to drop into your React Native application. [Sample demo usage shown here for the HOMEE Pro iOS app in the screenshot](https://www.homee.com/) ➡️

## Features

- A full-fledged turn-by-turn navigation UI for iPhone, iPad, and CarPlay that’s ready to drop into your application
- [Professionally designed map styles](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/) for daytime and nighttime driving
- Worldwide driving, cycling, and walking directions powered by [open data](https://www.mapbox.com/about/open/) and user feedback
- Traffic avoidance and proactive rerouting based on current conditions in [over 55 countries](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/directions/#traffic-data)
- Natural-sounding turn instructions powered by [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) (no configuration needed)
- Support for over two dozen languages

## Installation Requirements

Before installing the SDK, you will need to gather the appropriate credentials. The SDK requires two pieces of sensitive information from your Mapbox account. If you don't have a Mapbox account: [sign up](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) and navigate to your [Account page](https://account.mapbox.com/). You'll need:

- **A public access token**: From your account's [tokens page](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/), you can either copy your _default public token_ or click the **Create a token** button to create a new public token.
- **A secret access token with the `Downloads:Read` scope**.

1. From your account's [tokens page](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/), click the **Create a token** button.
1. From the token creation page, give your token a name and make sure the box next to the `Downloads:Read` scope is checked.
1. Click the **Create token** button at the bottom of the page to create your token.
1. The token you've created is a _secret token_, which means you will only have one opportunity to copy it somewhere secure.

## Installation

```
npm install @homee/react-native-mapbox-navigation
```

Read the iOS specific instructions below before running `pod install`.

### iOS Specific Instructions

Make sure your react native project has an Objective-C bridging header for swift. If you don't have a bridging header you can follow these steps here below in the dropdown.

<details>
<summary>
  Create an Objective-C bridging header
</summary>

1. From Xcode, go to: <br>
   File → New → File…
1. Select Swift File
1. Name your file Dummy or whatever you want
1. In the Group dropdown, make sure to select the group folder for your app, not the project itself.

After you create the Swift file, you should be prompted to choose if you want to configure an Objective-C Bridging Header. Select “Create Bridging Header”.

![bridging header](img/bridging-header.png)

This file is usually named YourProject-Bridging-Header.h. Don’t change this name manually, because Xcode configures the project with this exact filename.

</details>

There are a few build settings in Xcode that are necessary. Make sure to set `Don't Dead-strip Inits and Terms` to `YES` and `Dead Code Stripping` to `YES` for all projects/targets.

</details>

You will also need to remove the entry `"$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift-5.0/$(PLATFORM_NAME)"` from `Library Search Paths` if it is present for your project target -

</details>

Place your public token in your Xcode project's `Info.plist` and add a `MGLMapboxAccessToken` key whose value is your public access token.

Place your secret token in a `.netrc` file in your OS home directory that contains this:

```
machine api.mapbox.com
login mapbox
password <INSERT SECRET TOKEN>
```

Now you are ready to install the cocoapod:

```
cd ios && pod install
```

If you are experiencing a _"multiple commands produce"_ build error in your Xcode project then you will need to add this entry below to the top of your ios podfile:

`install! 'cocoapods', :disable_input_output_paths => true`

For more information you can read the [docs provided by Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/navigation/overview/#configure-credentials).

---

### Android Specific Instructions

Place your secret token in your android app's top level `gradle.properties` file:

```
MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN=SECRET_TOKEN_HERE
```

Open up your _project-level_ `build.gradle` file. Declare the Mapbox Downloads API's `releases/maven` endpoint in the `repositories` block.

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'https://api.mapbox.com/downloads/v2/releases/maven'
            authentication {
                basic(BasicAuthentication)
            }
            credentials {
                // Do not change the username below.
                // This should always be `mapbox` (not your username).
                username = "mapbox"
                // Use the secret token you stored in gradle.properties as the password
                password = project.properties['MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN'] ?: ""
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Place your public token in your project's `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<!-- This should be a child of the application tag -->
<meta-data android:name="MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    android:value="PUBLIC_TOKEN_HERE" />
```

For more information you can read the [docs provided by Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/overview/#configure-credentials).

## Usage

```jsx

export const SomeComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <MapboxNavigation
        origin={[-97.760288, 30.273566]}
        destination={[-97.918842, 30.494466]}
        shouldSimulateRoute={true}
        onLocationChange={(event) => {
          const { latitude, longitude } = event.nativeEvent;
        }}
        onRouteProgressChange={(event) => {
          const {
            distanceTraveled,
            durationRemaining,
            fractionTraveled,
            distanceRemaining,
          } = event.nativeEvent;
        }}
        onError={(event) => {
          const { message } = event.nativeEvent;
        }}
        onCancelNavigation={() => {
          // User tapped the "X" cancel button in the nav UI
          // or canceled via the OS system tray on android.
          // Do whatever you need to here.
        }}
        onArrive={() => {
          // Called when you arrive at the destination.
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});
```

### `MapboxNavigation` Props
